title: But the spark is not gone!

A presentation slide arguing the spark is not gone:
1) People at madison ruby last year who don't even work professionally in ruby
anymore
2) Artificial Ruby, my monthly Ruby+AI meetup in NYC regularly gets over 50
people on a wednesday night in New York for a language the AI industry
practically doesn't know exists
3) All of you here, none of you decided to head over and start happy hour early
