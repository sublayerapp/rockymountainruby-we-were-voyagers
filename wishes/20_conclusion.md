Title: The End!

<!-- Left side of the slide: -->
This quote on the left:
We were voyagers.
We discovered continents of possibility.
We got comfortable.
We drew maps.
We settled down.
But the universe got weird again.
The machines learned to dream.

Write code that makes you giggle.
Create tools that shouldn't exist.
The voyage never ended.
Welcome back, voyagers.
The sea is infinite again.
