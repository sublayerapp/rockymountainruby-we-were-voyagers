Visual: Split screen? Left: A very simple example prompt text (e.g., the prompt for this slide).
        Right: Maybe the MonkeysPaw logo or a super simple schema (Prompt -> AI -> HTML).

Title: MonkeysPaw: Prompt -> Web Page

On the left: Example Prompt Text in a vertically overflow scrolling box:
# MonkeysPaw Home Page

## Page Content

Create a dramatic, visually striking home page for the MonkeysPaw Ruby gem that introduces the concept of "wish-driven development." The page should convey both the power and the potential danger of using the framework.

### Hero Section
- Large, dramatic headline: "MonkeysPaw üêí‚úã"
- Tagline: "Wish-Driven Development for Ruby"
- Dramatic subtitle: "Be careful what you wish for..."
- Brief 2-3 sentence explanation: "A prompt-driven web framework that grants your web development wishes through AI. Like the legendary monkey's paw, it will fulfill your requests exactly as stated‚Äîfor better or worse."
- Call-to-action button: "Make Your First Wish" (links to Getting Started)

### Key Features Section
- Title: "The Power of the Paw"
- 3 feature cards with icons:
  1. **Prompt-Driven**: "Express your intentions through natural language, not code"
  2. **AI-Powered**: "Harness advanced language models to generate complete web pages"
  3. **Eerily Accurate**: "Get precisely what you ask for‚Äîexactly as you phrase it"
- Each card should have a subtle warning about the consequences of imprecise wishes

### How It Works Section
- Simple 3-step graphic showing:
  1. Write your wish (prompt)
  2. The paw curls (processing)
  3. Your page manifests (result)
- Include a brief code sample showing how simple it is to use:

```ruby
require 'monkeyspaw'

# Make your wish come true
MonkeysPaw.pick_up!
```
- Note explaining: "MonkeysPaw reads your wishes from the `wishes/` directory and manifests your content at http://localhost:1337"

### Testimonials Section
- Title: "Tales of Granted Wishes"
- 3-4 fictional but amusing testimonials that hint at both success and unexpected consequences:
  - "I wished for a contact form and got exactly that‚Äîthough I forgot to ask for form validation. Be specific!" ‚Äî Ruby Developer
  - "Asked for an 'eye-catching' header and now visitors can't look away... literally. Impressive, if slightly concerning." ‚Äî Web Designer
  - "The landing page I wished for converts 200% better than my hand-coded one. I'm both thrilled and slightly unnerved." ‚Äî Startup Founder

### Final Call-to-Action
- Large button: "Learn to Make Careful Wishes" (links to Getting Started)
- Small warning text beneath: "Remember: With great power comes the responsibility to be precise."

### Visual Elements
- Incorporate a subtle animated monkey's paw that curls one finger for each section scrolled
- Add magical/mystical accents without being too whimsical
- Create an atmosphere that balances wonder with a touch of foreboding
